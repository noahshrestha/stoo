# Sprint-based Technical Onboarding Objectives

Get technically onboarded to the Microsoft Azure approach to field-based development work in 6 sprints :)
Each sprint is planned for a week. We review the onboarding outcome on the Thursday of every week, and set about 
talking about the next sprint if all is well.
